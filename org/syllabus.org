* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete DSC 450 will be able to 
- demonstrate proficiency in applying advanced data science methods
  and tools.
- Successfully complete a comprehensive research project, showcasing
  the ability to work independently.
- Exhibit the ability to solve complex, real-world problems using
  data-driven approaches.
- Clearly communicate data findings and implications to diverse
  audiences through written reports and presentations.
- Display an understanding of ethical issues and responsible data use
  in their research and analyses.
- Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan, execute, and manage a
  data science project.

* Course requirements

No formal requirements. Relevant skills for independent research are
assumed - these skills can be obtained by completing projects in
previous courses in any subject.

Data science is an interdisciplinary field - data science research
does not have to include programming or mathematics and statistics but
it relies on at least beginning competence in a domain area.
