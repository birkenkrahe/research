** Overview

1. Is the time alright for you? Would 11-11:45 be better?
2. Let's look at the syllabus and the schedule
3. Let's hear from you: project ideas
4. Scientific method (some heretical ideas)
5. Journal club (31 Jan)

** Your projects

1. Marlon:
   - *Anomaly* detection in medical imaging
   - Specialised on *cancer* research
   - Detect and classify cancer cells
   - Start with unlabelled data
   - Cancer research is now adopting AI
   - It's new and theyre doing it now!
   - I know people who're doing

   Questions:
   - Where will you get your data?
   - National Cancer Imaging Archive
   - Is cancer a disease or a common condition?
   - Will I be able to convert the images (from XRay)?
   - Got the skills to face my fears

2. Pedro:
   - Two alternatives:
     1) Road service & monitoring quantity of signs: descriptive
        analysis of historic data to see if there are any patterns. 
     2) Automating road sign recognition (now done manually). Image recognition. Setting: civil engineering.
   - Father is potential client.
   - Leaning towards (1)

   Questions:
   - What kind of patterns are you looking for?
   - Nobody working with the client could do it!
   - What's the main benefit (to the client): can we make use of data science at all?
   - What's the situation with road signs on the ground?
   - Will be able to progress consistently?

3. Braden:
   - Sports analytics
   - Oil and natural gas as resources (pipeline)
   - Talk to other students who have done this
   - Take a look at projects at kaggle.com     
     
3. Thomas (via Email):
   #+begin_quote
    For my project I would like to continue my project from DSC 105
    last semester. I was unable to get to the machine learning side. I
    would like to some predictive analysis with baseball pitching
    data.

1. Informal presentation of someone else's work
2. Relevant to your research and your interests
3. Stimulating in a positive or negative way

* How to read someone else's paper   

How to read at all - see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-should-you-read][my 2021 FAQ]].

- Read a lot superficially (abstracts)
- Read a few publications more carefully (conclusions)
- Read very few publications very closely (everything)
- Use AI to help you summarize (risky)

* What AI thinks you should do.
Areas of attack for your reading:
